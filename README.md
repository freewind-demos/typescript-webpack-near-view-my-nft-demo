TypeScript Webpack Near View My NFT Demo
=================================

Suppose we already know self accountId, we can get our NFTs by `near-js-api`

Question:

Do we have to use an indexer to get the nft-like contract names?
Can we just use `near-js-api` to do all the things?

```
npm install
npm start
```

It will open page on browser automatically.
